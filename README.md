# Cadre

**Cadre runs a team of AI agents that builds a new project or finishes an existing one, using
only free model API keys.** It spreads the work across every provider you add, stays inside each
one's rate limits, and when a day's quota runs out it parks the run and picks it up after the reset.

You describe the team as one YAML file: who the agents are, which tools they may use, which
checks decide "done", and how they work together. Reviewers are routed to a *different* model
family from the builder. Programs such as tests and linters decide whether work passes, not model
opinions, and votes are counted by code.

## Quick start

Cadre needs Python 3.12 or newer. Install it with `pipx install cadre-ai` or
`uv tool install cadre-ai`, or run it without installing through
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) as `uvx --from cadre-ai cadre …`.
The command is `cadre`.

```bash
cadre provider add groq             # 1. a free key from console.groq.com, typed at a hidden prompt
cadre forecast project-finisher "Make the failing tests pass"                  # 2. will it fit today?
cadre run project-finisher "Make the failing tests pass" --project ./my-repo --allow-exec   # 3.
git -C my-repo log --stat cadre/<run-id>     # 4. review the branch; Cadre never merges
```

With no key at all, `cadre run decision-board "Should we open a second office?" --demo` runs an
offline scripted team.

## Measured, not claimed

Every number here except the token-cost comparison was observed on free Groq and Google AI Studio
keys on 2026-09-17/18 (the comparison is Cadre's own estimator, measured offline) and each is
recorded with its run id in [`docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`](https://github.com/Daemon-VI/cadre/blob/main/docs/PROJECT_STATE.md) (the M5 and M11
tables).

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| `decision-board` (a four-member council votes, the CEO chairs and writes the memo) | succeeded · 15 calls · 21.5k tokens · 125 s |
| `software-team --allow-exec` (spec → build → independent review → tests gate) | succeeded · 27 calls · 94.0k tokens · 466 s |
| `project-finisher` on a half-built fixture repository | succeeded · 14 calls · 16.8k tokens · 123 s · owner's tree unchanged |
| Capstone 1: build a unit-converter CLI | succeeded · `Ran 9 tests … OK` when re-run by hand |
| Capstone 2: finish a half-built package | succeeded · `Ran 8 tests … OK` on the delivered branch; owner's HEAD, branch and working tree unchanged |
| Defects that only real models exposed | 10, each fixed with a regression test built from the live response |
| One-line change: rewrite the file vs `edit_file` | 7,056 vs 134 tokens (Cadre's 4-characters-a-token estimate) |
| Server memory while a live run streamed | 64.5 MB idle, 72.9 MB peak |

## Limitations

- **Checks run as you unless you contain them.** By default a check runs code the agents wrote,
  as you, on your machine. The model can only name a check declared in the org file, never supply
  a command, and checks need `--allow-exec` or your approval. A check can instead run in a
  container with no network (`runner: docker` or `podman`), but a container shares the host's
  kernel and the workspace stays writable: see ADR-031 for what that does not protect. Don't give
  an untrusted goal to an org whose checks run as you, or, in project mode, to one whose checks
  run in a container.
- **Containment is proven on Linux only.** The container runner is tested against real Docker *and*
  Podman in Linux CI (no network, no writes outside `/work`, no planted key, no fork bomb, no
  memory overrun, timeout killed). Windows and macOS are untested, and Docker Desktop puts a VM in
  between whose behaviour differs.
- **Memory across runs did not help on the one task it was measured on.** n = 1: the model got the
  convention right first try with and without memory, so it saved no repair turns, and it costs
  about 94 tokens per model call. It may help on harder conventions; that is untested.
- **The GitHub Action's "left today" figure is wrong.** A runner's usage ledger starts empty, so it
  always reports the full free daily limit rather than what your key has actually spent.
- **Run *reads* are not scoped by team.** Any signed-in user can read any run; only the
  side-effecting actions — cancel, resume, decide approvals — and starting a run are team-scoped
  (ADR-034). Runs carry no secrets, so this is a deliberate trade, but it is not isolation.
- **No run has parked live yet.** Parking on a daily limit and resuming after the reset is
  verified with a fake clock. A real interrupted run did resume the next day without re-billing.
- **Review quality is not measured.** Only the routing of reviewers to another model family is.
- **Forecasts are rough.** They were off by up to 4.4× before recalibration, and 2.3× on a later
  run, because history is kept per org and not per project size.
- **Hand-tested on Windows only.** The interactive paths (approval prompts, the dashboard, the
  VS Code extension) were driven by hand on Windows; CI runs the suite on Linux, Windows and
  macOS × Python 3.12/3.13.
- **Free tiers change without notice.** Preset limits are dated starting values, corrected at
  run time by each provider's rate-limit headers.

## Install from source

Python 3.12+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daemon-VI/cadre && cd cadre
uv sync
uv run cadre init          # creates ~/.cadre (set CADRE_HOME to put it elsewhere)
```

## Try it with no key

The demo mode swaps in a scripted, offline model that exercises every workflow end to end. It
is plumbing, not intelligence: every answer it writes is marked `[demo]`.

```bash
uv run cadre run decision-board "Should we open a second office?" --demo
uv run cadre run software-team "a word counter" --demo --allow-exec
```

## Front ends

Cadre is one engine (`cadre serve`, a local API at `/api/v1`), and each of these is a thin client
of it (ADR-024):

- **AI editors (MCP):** `uvx --from "cadre-ai[mcp]" cadre mcp` gives Claude Code, VS Code, Cursor,
  Windsurf and Antigravity six tools: forecast, start a run, run status, usage, list orgs and
  list memory.
  They can't approve anything. There's a config snippet for each host in
  [`docs/MCP_HOSTS.md`](https://github.com/Daemon-VI/cadre/blob/main/docs/MCP_HOSTS.md).
- **GitHub Action:** label an issue `cadre` or comment `/cadre <goal>`. Cadre runs
  `project-finisher` on the checkout and opens a pull request with its report and usage table.
  Only the owner, members and collaborators can trigger it. Copy
  [`examples/github-action/cadre.yml`](https://github.com/Daemon-VI/cadre/blob/main/examples/github-action/cadre.yml) and add a free key as a
  repository secret.
- **VS Code extension:** `ext install daemon-vi.cadre-ai`, or search **Cadre AI** in the
  Extensions pane. Runs, a live run view, and (since 1.4.0) panels for a new-run form, usage
  meters, approvals, memory and organisations. Published to the
  [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=daemon-vi.cadre-ai) and
  [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/daemon-vi/cadre-ai), so it installs in Cursor, Windsurf,
  Antigravity and VSCodium too. Source: [`editors/vscode`](https://github.com/Daemon-VI/cadre/tree/main/editors/vscode).
  (It is `cadre-ai`, not `cadre`: the Marketplace requires globally unique names and both `cadre`
  and the display name `Cadre` were already taken.)
- **Container:** `ghcr.io/daemon-vi/cadre`, non-root, state in `/data`, keys from environment
  variables. See [`compose.yaml`](compose.yaml).
- **Standalone downloads** for Windows, macOS and Linux are attached to each GitHub Release. They
  are unsigned, so SmartScreen and Gatekeeper will warn. Checks that use `{python}` need a Python
  on PATH.

On a server, in CI or in a container with no keychain, set `CADRE_NO_KEYRING=1`, put keys in
environment variables, and run `cadre provider add-from-env` to register every free provider
whose key is present.

## Add a free model

```bash
uv run cadre presets               # every provider Cadre knows, with free-tier notes
uv run cadre provider add groq     # prompts for the key with input hidden
uv run cadre provider list
uv run cadre provider test groq
uv run cadre provider key groq     # replace a stored key, e.g. after rotating it
```

The key goes to the OS credential store (Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Secret
Service), never to a file. Environment variables work too, checked first:
`CADRE_KEY_GROQ`, then the provider's usual name (`GROQ_API_KEY`). On a headless machine with no
keychain (a server, a container, CI), set `CADRE_NO_KEYRING=1` and pass keys only as environment
variables.

Add as many providers as you have keys. More providers means more parallel capacity and real
reviewer independence.

```bash
uv run cadre provider add gemini
uv run cadre provider add openrouter          # discovers the current :free models
uv run cadre provider models openrouter       # what the endpoint serves today
uv run cadre provider set-model groq openai/gpt-oss-20b --tier fast --tpm 8000
```

## Run a team

```bash
uv run cadre run software-team "a CSV to Markdown table converter" --allow-exec
uv run cadre run startup-company "Launch a flashcard app for engineering students"
uv run cadre runs
uv run cadre show <run-id> --events
uv run cadre resume <run-id>        # finished steps are reused, not re-billed
uv run cadre cancel <run-id>
```

Without `--allow-exec`, the first check asks you before running anything. Approval gates and
agent questions are asked in the terminal; add `--yes` to auto-approve gates, or
`--approve-elsewhere` to answer from the dashboard or `cadre approve <id>`.

Every run gets a workspace at `~/.cadre/runs/<run-id>/workspace/`, with every file version kept
under `versions/`.

## Finish an existing project

```bash
uv run cadre run project-finisher "Make the failing tests pass" --project C:\path\to\repo --allow-exec
```

Cadre works in a git worktree on a new branch `cadre/<run-id>` and commits each finished step
there with your repository's own identity. Your working tree, current branch and uncommitted
changes are never touched (a dirty tree is refused unless you pass `--allow-dirty`), and Cadre
never merges or pushes. Checks come from the org file and from `.cadre/checks.yaml` as committed
at the base commit, for example:

```yaml
checks:
  - name: tests
    command: ["{python}", "-m", "pytest", "-q"]
```

or, to run them in a container with no network (`{python}` is then the image's `python3`):

```yaml
checks:
  - name: tests
    command: ["{python}", "-m", "unittest", "-v"]
    runner: docker                     # or podman
    image: "python:3.12-slim@sha256:2f17fc044b579bab302c2e8054d3a686e2cb9a83de48e70534b94cd8ebbe06a9"
    memory: 512m                       # defaults: 512m, 1 CPU, 256 processes
    env: [LANG]                        # passed by name; key-like names are refused
```

Cadre never pulls the image: the first run tells you the `docker pull` command to run.

The run ends by printing the branch's commits, `git diff --stat`, and the commands to review or
discard it. `cadre runs cleanup` removes finished worktrees and keeps their branches.

## Will it fit? Usage and forecasts

```bash
uv run cadre forecast software-team "a CSV to Markdown table converter"
uv run cadre usage --days 7
```

The forecast answers *fits now*, *fits today after ~N min of waits*, *needs ~N days* or *cannot
run*, and always says its basis: `measured, n = …` once an org has finished runs, or `no history,
estimated from template size` before that. `cadre run` prints it before starting. The usage
ledger shows requests, tokens and the share of each daily cap per day, provider and model, with
the next reset in IST.

## Long jobs: parking and resuming

When every model a run can use has hit its *daily* limit, the run is **parked** instead of
failing, with the time it can continue (each provider's own reset clock). Nothing already finished
is repeated or billed again when it resumes.

```bash
uv run cadre serve                 # resumes parked runs by itself while it is running
uv run cadre resume --due          # or resume every run whose reset has passed, once
uv run cadre scheduler install     # or check every 30 minutes from the OS scheduler (asks first)
```

Budgets count everything a run has used across days. `max_days` (default 7) stops a run that has
gone on too long; `max_tokens_per_day` spreads a job over several days; `cadre resume <id>
--add-calls 20` raises a stopped run's allowance.

## Dashboard

```bash
uv run cadre serve       # http://127.0.0.1:8765, loopback only
uv run cadre ui          # opens the browser with the access token in the URL fragment
```

To reach it through a Tailscale name or from a container, add `--allowed-host NAME` (repeatable,
exact names only); anything else is still refused. The API is versioned at `/api/v1`.

Runs with a live timeline, files, per-agent token usage and results; organisations with a YAML
editor and validator; models and keys with live quota bars; pending approvals.

## Templates

| Template | Pattern | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `software-team` | sequence → review loop → docs | PM writes a spec, engineer builds and tests, an independent reviewer checks it, `compile` and `tests` checks gate it, a writer documents it |
| `decision-board` | council | CFO, CTO, CMO and a risk officer propose, critique, and vote; the CEO chairs, breaks ties and writes the memo |
| `startup-company` | manager | A founder plans a task graph for researcher, engineer, designer and marketer; a QA lead reviews each deliverable |
| `project-finisher` | manager (repo checks, reviewer) | Finishes work in an existing repository (`--project`): the lead plans, the engineer edits, the repo's own checks gate, a reviewer on another family advises, a branch is delivered |
| `research-desk` | parallel → review loop → approval | Three analysts in parallel, an editor merges, a fact-checker reviews, a human approves |

Copy one to edit: `uv run cadre org new my-team --from software-team`, then
`uv run cadre org validate my-team`.

## The organisation file

```yaml
name: tiny-team
agents:
  - id: builder
    role: Python engineer
    tools: [list_files, read_file, write_file, run_check]
  - id: reviewer
    role: Code reviewer
    diverse_from: builder          # prefer a different model family
    tools: [list_files, read_file]
checks:
  - name: tests
    command: ["{python}", "-m", "unittest", "discover", "-p", "test_*.py"]
budget: {max_calls: 40, max_tokens: 150000, max_minutes: 20, max_parallel: 2}
workflow:
  - builder: builder
    reviewers: [reviewer]
    checks: [tests]
    max_rounds: 3
    task: "Build {goal} in app.py with tests in test_app.py."
```

Step types (`type:` may be omitted when the keys make it obvious):

| Type | Does |
|---|---|
| `agent` | one agent, one task, bounded tool turns |
| `sequence` | steps in order (a bare list is a sequence); `{prev}` is the last output |
| `parallel` | steps at once, optionally combined by a `join` agent |
| `review_loop` | builder → checks → reviewers (JSON verdicts) → feedback, up to `max_rounds` |
| `council` | proposals → critique rounds → options → votes → tally (`majority`, `supermajority`, `unanimous`, `plurality`) → memo |
| `manager` | manager plans a task graph, workers run it in dependency order, optional reviewer, final report |
| `approval` | wait for a human |

Templates can use `{goal}`, `{prev}` and `{out.<step id>}`. Tools: `list_files`, `read_file`,
`search`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `post_note`, `run_check`, `ask_human` (see *Agent tools*).
Everything is validated before the first
model call, and errors name their path in the file.

## Free providers (checked 2026-09-17)

Every free chat model a key reaches is its own quota bucket. Each provider also has its own
daily clock and a recorded answer to "does the free tier train on my prompts?".

| Preset | Models and limits Cadre starts from | Day resets | Trains on free prompts |
|---|---|---|---|
| `groq` | `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `gpt-oss-20b`, `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`: 30 RPM, 1,000 RPD, 8,000 TPM, 200k TPD each (docs). Two model families on one key | rolling (no clock published; headers override) | no |
| `gemini` | Seven chat models, each its own bucket: Gemini 3.8/3.7/3.6/3.5 Flash, 3 Flash preview, 3.5/3.1 Flash-Lite (the 2.5 models answered 404 to a new key on 2026-09-17). Google publishes no per-model numbers; Flash 20 RPD and Flash-Lite 500 RPD are third-party reports, the rest are guesses; a daily-quota 429 teaches Cadre the real limit | midnight Pacific (docs) | **yes** |
| `openrouter` | `:free` models, discovered: 20 RPM, 50/day (1,000/day once 10 credits were ever bought) (docs) | UTC day (docs) | unknown — depends on the model's host |
| `mistral` | medium/small: 2 RPM (reported) | not stated | **yes** unless you opt out |
| `cohere` | `command-a-03-2025`: 20 RPM, 1,000 calls/month, non-commercial (docs) | not stated | yes unless you opt out |
| `nvidia` | `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`: 40 RPM (reported); trial credits | not stated | **yes** (trial terms) |
| `cloudflare` | Llama 3.3 70B, gpt-oss-120b: 10,000 neurons/day, 300 RPM; needs `--param account_id=…` | 00:00 UTC (docs) | no |
| `zai` | `glm-4.7-flash`, `glm-4.5-flash` (free per docs; limits guessed) | not stated | unknown |
| `huggingface` | ~$0.10 credit/month | counted per UTC day (the credit itself is monthly) | unknown — depends on the upstream provider |
| `ollama`, `llamacpp`, `lmstudio` | local, no key, no limits — slow on an 8 GB laptop | — | no |
| `deepseek`, `openai`, `anthropic`, `custom` | **paid**, opt-in, same adapter. DeepSeek has no free tier, and OpenRouter listed no free DeepSeek model on 2026-09-17 | — | — |

Free catalogues change without notice: Cerebras became a card-required trial and GitHub Models
was retired in July 2026. These numbers are only starting values. Cadre overrides them with each
provider's own rate-limit headers, `cadre provider refresh` shows what each endpoint serves today
(`--apply` adds new models and disables vanished ones, never touching limits you set), and any
number can be changed with `cadre provider set-model`. Cadre keeps 10% of every daily cap unused
(`reserve_pct`) for other programs that share the key.

Use **one account per provider.** Capacity grows by adding *different* providers; several
accounts or projects at one provider to multiply a free limit breaks their terms.

### Private runs

`cadre run … --private` (or `privacy: private` in the org file) only uses providers that say they
do not train on prompts — today Groq, Cloudflare and local models. The run records which models it
excluded, and fails before its first call if none are left.

## Agent tools

`list_files`, `read_file` (optionally a line range), `search` (regex, capped), `write_file`,
`edit_file` (replace one exact, unique match — far cheaper than rewriting a file), `post_note`,
`run_check` (a check *named* in the org file) and `ask_human`. An agent only gets the tools its
entry lists. Agents with file tools also see a capped repo map: paths, line counts and top-level
Python classes and functions.

## Safety

- **By default, checks run code the agents wrote, as you, on your machine. That is not a
  sandbox.** The model can only name a check declared in the org file; it never supplies a
  command. Checks run in the run's workspace with a timeout, capped output, and an environment
  stripped of anything that looks like a key, token or password. They need `--allow-exec` or
  your approval.
- **A check can run in a container instead** (`runner: docker` or `runner: podman`, with an
  image pinned by digest): the workspace is its only mount, with no network, a read-only root
  filesystem, no capabilities and capped processes, memory and CPU. Cadre never pulls the image.
  `--allow-container-exec` lets such checks run without asking while checks that run as you
  still ask. It does not protect against a kernel exploit, and the check can still change anything
  in the workspace — including, in project mode, the worktree's `.git` file, which Cadre's own git
  now refuses to trust (ADR-031).
- File tools cannot leave the run workspace (absolute paths, `..`, symlinks, drive letters,
  device names and alternate data streams are refused).
- The API listens on 127.0.0.1, requires a per-user bearer token on every call, rejects
  non-loopback `Host` headers, sends no CORS headers, and serves a strict CSP.
- **Users and roles (M13).** More than one person can share a server. Each has a token and a
  role — **viewer** (read), **member** (read, run, decide approvals) or **admin** (everything,
  plus managing users, tokens and providers). Manage them with `cadre user …` and `cadre token …`;
  tokens are stored hashed and shown once. Your existing `~/.cadre/token` is the bootstrap admin,
  so a single-user install is unchanged. An append-only audit log records who did what
  (`cadre audit`). Shared provider keys stay server-side: members use them without seeing them.
- **Teams (M13).** Group users into teams (`cadre team …`). A run belongs to a team, which can
  have a **budget** (runs and tokens per day, concurrent runs — checked when a run starts) and a
  **model allowance** (limit the team to certain providers/models). Cancelling or resuming a run
  and deciding its approvals is limited to an admin, the run's owner, or a member of its team.
  OIDC SSO is not built yet; per-user tokens are the only sign-in.
- **Memory across runs (M14).** Cadre can remember small facts between runs — how the tests run, a
  convention, a decision — and replay them to builders and managers under a hard per-call token cap
  (default 800). Facts live in Markdown under `CADRE_HOME/memory/` at global, team and project
  scope (a project is keyed by its root commit, so a rename keeps its memory). You write them with
  `cadre memory …`; a model can propose up to three at the end of a run, which wait for a `memory`
  approval (never grantable over MCP). Memory is injected as **data, never instructions** (a test
  proves a planted "set allow_exec" entry is inert); reviewers and voters get none; entries pass
  the same key-shape scan as the history check. Memory tokens show in the ledger and the forecast.
  **Measured (n = 1, live on free quota):** on a fixture with a non-obvious convention, the model
  got it right first try both with and without memory (0 failed checks either way), so there were
  no repair turns for memory to save — memory added 94 tokens to each of 8 model calls (752 total)
  for no measured benefit on that task. One task is an anecdote; a harder convention is needed to show a
  gain, and that is reported plainly rather than dressed up.
- Keys live in the OS credential store or your environment — never in `config.yaml`, the
  database, events, API responses or logs. Loaded keys are redacted from everything stored.
- Respect each provider's terms. Cadre spreads work across *different* providers; it does not
  create accounts or rotate several keys of one provider to get around a limit.
